When I faced this problem I found that I didn't need those gems in development, because rails use to precompile your assets, so my solution was pretty simple,
Gemfile

gem "rails"

group :production do
  gem 'therubyracer'
end

Then when you bundle run this command

$ bundle install --without production

didn't work to me
------------------
need to install libv8 manually

git clone git://github.com/cowboyd/libv8.git
cd libv8

bundle install
bundle exec rake checkout
bundle exec rake compile

failed on checkout.

instead install node.js binary msi to get v8 install
and then

gem install libv8  -v 3.16.14.7 -- --with-system-v8

gem install therubyracer -- --with-system-v8


failed again

git clone git://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer.git
cd therubyracer
bundle install
bundle exec rake compile

git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8
cd v8

svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp --revision 1831

gem install libv8 -v '3.11.8.13' -- --with-system-v8
