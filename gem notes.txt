bundle gem rails_flickr

gemspec file (rails_flickr.gemspec in this case)

it's necessary to update the version number here to reflect the latest available version on RubyGems.org. 
It's considered a best practice to follow semantic versioning. In short, what this means according to semver.org:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. 
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
