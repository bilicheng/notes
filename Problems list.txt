error: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed

tried to fix it, using the following link method
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5720484/how-to-solve-certificate-verify-failed-on-windows

Download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into C:\Ruby193\cerf\cacert.pem
Go to your Computer -> Advanced Settings -> Environment Variables
Create a new System Variable:

Variable: SSL_CERT_FILE

Value: C:\Ruby193\cerf\cacert.pem

set > filepath.txt

check SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\Ruby193\cerf\cacert.pem

still failed

need to hack in
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23263121/ruby-ssl-with-twitter-failed-on-cert-openssl-issue-on-windows-7
irb> require 'openssl'
irb> puts OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE
found its path
 
Then opened a "Windows PowerShell ISE" as admin mode 
made up a directory C:\users\Luis\Code\openknapsack\knap-build\var\knapsack\software\x86-windows\openssl\1.0.0k\ssl
cp C:\Ruby193\cerf\cacert.pem .\cert.pem

works now
